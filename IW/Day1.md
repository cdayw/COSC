##  Multi-Domain Operations 
````
LSA (1) Five Operational Domains
  - Space
    ! Greater than 100 kilometers above mean sea level
  - Air
  - Sea (Maritime)
  - Land
  - Cyber
    ! Layers of Cyber Space
      +  Physical Network Layer
        + Logical Network Layer
          + Cyber-persona Layer


LSA (2) Explain the Joint All-Domain Operaitons Concept
  JADO is the integration of all service component and functional operational structures at local and regional echelons to
  coordinate and synchronize land, air, maritime, cyber, and space operations with ease and to a greate exten than current.


LSA (3) Outline the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) and MEF INFORMATION GORUP (MIG)
  MDTFs are foward-stationed formations able to execute aspects of multi-domain operations

  Mutli-DOmain Effects Batallion (MDEB)
  The MDEB supports MDTF targeting efffors by providing near real-time signals intelligence (SIGINT),
  geospational intelligence (GEOINT), and open source (OSINT) target acquisition and products.   

  MEF INFORMATION GORUP (MIG)
  MIG coordinates,integrates, and employs capabilities for information environment operations in order
  to ensure MAGTF Commander's ability to facilitate
    -  Stand In Forces
    -  Mobility
    -  Persistence  (key maritime terrain)
    -  Low Signature (physical and EMS)
    -  Integrated Naval Forces
    -  Cost Effective

  EABO - A form of expeditionary warefare that involves the employment of mobile, low-signature, persistent,
  and relatively easy to maintain and sustain naval expeditionary forces

## Intro to Joint Operations
```
LSA (1) US Joint Force Structure
  The United States entered WW2 with an
  archaic military org., incapable of
  coordinating land, sea, and air activities
  across its two military departments (War and Navy)

  In 1942 President FDR created the Join Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
  by executive direction, primarily to work with the British.

  During and After WW2, numerous effots sought to rectify
  the U.S militarys disjointedness
    - The National Security Act of 1947
    

  Leglistlated revisions to the National Secuirty Act in 1949, 1953, and 1958
  attempted to ammend these deficiencies
    - Strengthening the SECDEF
    - Establishing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS)
    - Removing military secretaries and Service Chiefs from operational chain of command
    - Giving Unified commanders full operational command of assigned forces

  However, these provisions were not effectively implemented, so the military departments retained a de facto role in the
  operational chain of command and never complied with the provision of strengthening the unified commanders


  Numerous military failures highlighted institutional deficiencies at all levels.
  The Adhoc Nature of the joint effort in these operations ontributed to an inability to
  effectively link tactical actions to strategic ends.
    - Vietnam War
    - USS Pueblo
    - SS Mayaguez
    - Operation EAGLE CLAW (Iran hostage rescues)
    - Marine Barracks Beirut
    - Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada Invasion)

  Goldwater-Nichols Act 1986
  In addition to the impetus provided by these operational failures, several disparate factos came together in the mid-1980s
  which enabled DOD organizational change. These included extensive congressional hearings, a major senate inquiry, bi-partisan
  openness to rectify the situation, a presidential commission, and the appointment of a reform-minded CJCS, Admiral William Crowe
  in October 1985.
    Major Changes:
      - Chain of Command and Miltary Advice
      - Interaction of the Services
      - Personnel Management
      - Shared Procurement

  Supported Commander
    - Has the authority to exercise general direction of supporting effort
    - Designation and prioritization of missions, targerts, or objectives
    - Time and Duration of supporting aciton
    - Other actions for coordination and efficiency

  Global Force Management (GFM) is a group of related process that establish strategic C2 and strategic posture and provide insight to global miltary force availability
  based on miltary plans and opeations to support DoD's strategic decisions. GFM integrates directed readiness, assignment, allocation, apportionment, and assessment processes
  for force management and planning constructs
    - SECDEF assigns, allocates, apportions forces to CCDR's for planning 



LSA (2) Outline Current Combatent Commands
  Joint commands are established by missions and responsibilities often based on either a
  geographic AOR or functions
  CCDRs' forces can operate wherever they are required to accomplish missions

  Interagency means Department of the Army could be doing an op with the Department of the Navy and the CIA

  Title 10 Gives the Responsibility for the Armed Forces to the Secretary of Defense
  
  Title 22 The Secretary of State is responsible for assisting the President with foreign policy


LSA (3) Explain Joint Operations
  Joint Operations are military Actions Conducted by joint forces and those service forces
  employed in specified command relationships with each other, which of themselves do not
  establish joint forces

  A Joint Force is one composed of signifcant elements, assigned or attatched, of two or more
  military departments operating under a single joint force commander

  Competition Continuum
    - Cooperation
    - Adversarial Competition
    - Armed Conflict/War

  Levels of Warfare
    - Strategic
    - Operational
    - Tactical

## The Information Environment and Operations
```
LSA (1) Examine the Information Environment
  Information Environment is the aggregate of social, cultural psychological, technical
  and physical factors that affect how humans and automated system derive meaning from
  act upon and are impacted by information, including the individuals, organizations, and systems
  that collect, process, dissseminate, or use informations
    - Informational Aspects
    - Physical Aspect
    - Human Aspects

  Information Aspects reflect the way that individuals, information systems, and groups communicate and exchange information.
  These are the sensory inputs of activites that a reciever interprets and uses to assign meaning

  Physical Aspects are the material characters, both natur and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhance communication
  These may create constraints and freedoms on the people and information systems that operate in it. Physical Aspects are critical elements of group identity
  and impact how groups form and behave.

  Human Aspects are the interactions amon and between people and the environment that shape human behavior and decision making. Those interactions are based
  upon the linguisticm social, culture, psychological, and physical elements

  The Elevation of Information as a joint function impacts all operations and signals a fundamental appreciation for the military role of information
  at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels within today's complex OE.

  Assessment of information in joint operations are conducted in accordance with the Operation Assessment Process

LSA (2) Describe how the Join Force Applies Informational Power, Organization of OIE
  Information Forces, the building blocks of OIE units, are those Active Component and Reserve Component forces specifically
  organized, trained, and equipped to create and/or support the creation of effects on the IE
  Information Forces are the building blocks of OIE units.

  Effective integration of the appropriate U.S government organizations will enhance the overall sucess of joint force ops.
  There are multiple organizations inside and outside DOD that are relevant to the joint force;s management and application of
  information
