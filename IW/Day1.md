  -Air
  -Sea (Maritime)
  -Land
  -Cyber
    ! Layers of Cyber Space
      +  Physical Network Layer
        + Logical Network Layer
          + Cyber-persona Layer


LSA (2) Explain the Joint All-Domain Operaitons Concept

  geospational intelligence (GEOINT), and open source (OSINT) target acquisition and products.   

  MEF INFORMATION GORUP (MIG)
  MIG coordinates,integrates, and employs capabilities for information environment operations in order
  to ensure MAGTF Commander's ability to facilitate
    -Stand In Forces
    -Mobility
    -Persistence  (key maritime terrain)
    -Low Signature (physical and EMS)
    -Integrated Naval Forces
    -Cost Effective

  EABO - A form of expeditionary warefare that involves the employment of mobile, low-signature, persistent,
  and relatively easy to maintain and sustain naval expeditionary forces
