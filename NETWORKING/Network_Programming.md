# Network Programming

## Socket Types and Privilege Level
```
    User Space Sockets - The most common sockets that do not require elevated privileges to perform actions on behalf of user applications.

    Kernel Space Sockets - Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user application to either prevent encapsulation/decapsulation or to create packets from scratch, which requires elevated privileges.
```
## Socket (socket.socket())
```
The function socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor for the socket. It uses three arguments:

    domain, which specifies the protocol family of the created socket. For example:

        AF_INET for network protocol IPv4 (IPv4-only)

        AF_INET6 for IPv6 (and in some cases, backward compatible with IPv4)

        AF_UNIX for local socket (using a file)

import socket
  s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)

socket.socket( *family*, *type*, *proto* )

    family: AF_INET*, AF_INET6, AF_UNIX

    type: SOCK_STREAM*, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW

    proto: 0*, IPPROTO_TCP, IPPROTO_UDP, IPPROTO_IP, IPPROTO_ICMP, IPPROTO_RAW
```
## TCP Stream Client .py script
```
import socket

# This can also be accomplished by using s = socket.socket() due to AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM being defaults
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

ipaddr = '127.0.0.1'
port = 1111

s.connect((ipaddr, port))

# To send a string as a bytes-like object, add the prefix b to the string. \n is used to go to the next line (hit enter)
s.send(b'Message\n')

# It is recommended that the buffersize used with recvfrom is a power of 2 and not a very large number of bits
data, conn = s.recvfrom(1024)

# In order to receive a message that is sent as a bytes-like-object you must decode into utf-8 (default)
print(data.decode('utf-8'))

s.close()
```
## UDP DGRAM CLIENT - ** use -u option on netcat for UDP -> nc -lvp 2222 -u 
```
import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

ipaddr = '127.0.0.1'
port = 2222

# To send a string as a bytes-like object, add the prefix b to the string. \n is used to go to the next line (hit enter)
s.sendto(b'Message\n', (ipaddr,port))

# It is recommended that the buffersize used with recvfrom is a power of 2 and not a very large number of bits
response, conn = s.recvfrom(1024)

# In order to receive a message that is sent as a bytes-like-object you must decode into utf-8 (default)
print(response.decode())
```
## RAW IPv4 - sudo tcpdump 'ip[4:2] = 1775' -XXvv
